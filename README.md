# AI vs Real Image Classifier

A deep learning project that classifies images as **AI-generated** or **real** using computer vision techniques.

This repository contains the full pipeline for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and inference.

## 🚀 Project Overview

With the rapid improvement of image generation models, identifying AI-generated images has become increasingly difficult.  
This project builds a binary image classifier that learns to distinguish **real photographs** from **AI-generated images**.
